## Hi there 👋

# 📌 Introduction
I am Spanish and have been professionally dedicated to Geographic Information Systems for almost 30 years, managing projects. In recent years, I have returned to programming, something I hadn't done since my youth and never fully developed.

## 🎯 Interests and Hobbies
I really enjoy sports, especially triathlon 🚴‍♂️. I have participated in and completed the Ironman four times.

## 🛠 Skills and Expertise
I mainly work with the ArcGIS platform because it has been the one I have used throughout my professional life, the one used in my current company, and the one required by my clients. I program in JavaScript and Python. Lately, I have been focusing a lot on learning React.
